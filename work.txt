Work Streams
============
Rino Jose <@rjose>

All streams are tab separated. The first line is a stream header of the form
"=====<title>". All subsequent lines must start with a tab character.

The fields of this stream must appear as follows:

        . id :: String
        . rank :: Int
        . name :: String
        . estimate :: String (with format like "Apps:S,Native:2M")
        . triage :: String  (one of "1", "1.5", "2", "2.5", "3")
        . track :: String
        . team :: String
        . value :: String (this is really a number as a string)
        . prereqs :: String

The estimate string has a format like "Apps:S,Native:2M". This is a comma
separated list of skill/estimate pairs. Estimates are S, M, L, and Q which are
interpreted as 1, 2, 3, and 13 man-weeks, respectively. A scalar factor may
precede the estimate. The intent is that there are multiple people required
for that time. For instance, "App:3M" can be interpreted as needing 3 apps
engineers for 2 weeks each.

The prereqs field should be a comma separated list of task IDs (e.g.,
"2EA61,B2142") and is meant to represent tasks in other teams that depend on
this task.
